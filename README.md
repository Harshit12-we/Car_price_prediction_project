# Car Price Prediction — Machine Learning Model Project
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can estimate the selling price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and other relevant specifications. The goal is to create a reliable predictive system that helps understand how different factors influence market value.

The workflow includes data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation. Multiple regression techniques and comparison metrics are used to determine the most accurate model for predicting car prices. Visualizations help highlight patterns and relationships within the dataset, providing deeper insights into pricing behaviour.

This repository is valuable for learners and practitioners working on supervised learning, regression modelling, and real-world data applications. It also offers a practical foundation for expanding the project into a full-scale price recommendation system.
